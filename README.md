# Memory Allocation Simulator

This project is a memory allocation simulator that implements fixed memory allocation methods. It allows you to allocate and deallocate processes in different memory partitions.

## Files

- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the memory allocation simulator. It provides the user interface for interacting with the simulator. The user can enter the process size, select a partition from 0 to 5 for allocation and deallocation, and perform the corresponding actions.

- `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the memory allocation simulator. It defines the layout, colors, and formatting of the different elements in the simulator's user interface.

- `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for the memory allocation simulator. It implements the logic for creating partitions, allocating processes, deallocating processes, and updating the user interface accordingly.

## Usage

To use the memory allocation simulator, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The simulator interface will be displayed, allowing you to enter the process size, select a partition for allocation or deallocation, and perform the corresponding actions.

The simulator supports two fixed memory allocation methods: equal size and unequal size. You can choose the desired method by selecting the corresponding radio button in the simulator interface. For the equal size method, you need to enter the number of partitions and the total memory size. For the unequal size method, you will be prompted to enter the size for each partition individually.

After creating the partitions, you can allocate a process by entering its size and selecting a partition. The simulator will visually represent the allocated process within the chosen partition. To deallocate a process, select the partition where the process is allocated, and the simulator will remove it from the partition.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different partition sizes, process allocations, and deallocations using the simulator.
